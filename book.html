          <p>
            It’s incredible to think how, just a little while ago, we were in the same coaching but had different batches. I switched from the morning batch to the evening one, and that small change led to us connecting through a friends' group, then to chatting on Snapchat, and before I knew it, we became best friends.
            At first, I didn’t know how things would unfold or if we’d connect, but now, after spending so much time together, I realize just how special what we have is.
You’re are the best kido. 💖

your laughter, the way you make me smile — everything about you has found a special place in my heart. I never expected to meet someone like you, but now, I can’t imagine my life without you in it.

Maybe it wasn’t fate or luck, but the effort we both put in and the love we shared that brought us together.. 💕

            The best part of my day is always when I get a text from you. No matter what kind of mood I'm in, it instantly lifts my spirits and makes me smile. Just hearing from you brightens everything, and I can’t help but feel happy.            You have a way of making the simplest moments special.
            
            Every little detail you share with me, whether big or small, just makes me feel so good. It’s like we’re right there with each other, even if we’re miles apart. It’s amazing how your words can make me feel so close to you.            
            The video calls we have every night are something I truly cherish. No matter how exhausted we are, those moments of seeing your face and hearing your voice help me relax and make me feel at ease.          </p>
